- 👋 Hi, I’m @BginZ
- 👀 I’m interested in game programming and 3d modelling
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and Blender
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any game related project to get a feel of real working environment and learn skill from professionals. (If you are willing accept a beginner into the team)
- 📫 How to reach me : a.smithipanon@gmail.com ,  Line: asmith17715


Here I will be posting script I wrote myself during my study. And to be honest I don't think it would be useful to anyone.
